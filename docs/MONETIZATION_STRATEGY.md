## Part 4: Payment Implementation

### 4.1 Payment Provider: Stripe

**Why Stripe:**
- Native Convex integration available
- Handles subscriptions, invoicing, tax
- Global payment methods
- Enterprise-grade security

**Implementation with Convex:**
```typescript
// convex/stripe.ts - Subscription management
export const createCheckoutSession = action({
  args: {
    priceId: v.string(),
    successUrl: v.string(),
    cancelUrl: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");
    
    const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
      mode: "subscription",
      payment_method_types: ["card"],
      line_items: [{ price: args.priceId, quantity: 1 }],
      success_url: args.successUrl,
      cancel_url: args.cancelUrl,
      customer_email: identity.email,
      metadata: { oderId: identity.subject },
    });
    
    return { url: session.url };
  },
});
```

### 4.2 Subscription Schema

```typescript
// Add to convex/schema.ts
subscriptions: defineTable({
  oderId: v.string(),
  stripeCustomerId: v.string(),
  stripeSubscriptionId: v.string(),
  plan: v.string(), // "free" | "pro" | "team" | "enterprise"
  status: v.string(), // "active" | "canceled" | "past_due"
  currentPeriodEnd: v.number(),
  seats: v.optional(v.number()),
  teamId: v.optional(v.id("teams")),
})
  .index("by_oderId", ["oderId"])
  .index("by_stripeCustomerId", ["stripeCustomerId"]),

teams: defineTable({
  name: v.string(),
  slug: v.string(),
  ownerId: v.string(),
  subscriptionId: v.optional(v.id("subscriptions")),
  settings: v.optional(v.object({
    allowedDomains: v.optional(v.array(v.string())),
    ssoEnabled: v.optional(v.boolean()),
  })),
})
  .index("by_slug", ["slug"])
  .index("by_ownerId", ["ownerId"]),

teamMembers: defineTable({
  teamId: v.id("teams"),
  oderId: v.string(),
  role: v.string(), // "owner" | "admin" | "member"
  invitedAt: v.number(),
  joinedAt: v.optional(v.number()),
})
  .index("by_teamId", ["teamId"])
  .index("by_oderId", ["oderId"]),
```

### 4.3 Feature Gating Implementation

```typescript
// convex/subscriptions.ts
export const getUserPlan = query({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) return { plan: "free", features: FREE_FEATURES };
    
    const subscription = await ctx.db
      .query("subscriptions")
      .withIndex("by_oderId", (q) => q.eq("oderId", identity.subject))
      .first();
    
    if (!subscription || subscription.status !== "active") {
      return { plan: "free", features: FREE_FEATURES };
    }
    
    return {
      plan: subscription.plan,
      features: PLAN_FEATURES[subscription.plan],
    };
  },
});

const FREE_FEATURES = {
  aiRecommendationsPerMonth: 3,
  maxDecks: 1,
  maxComparisons: 2,
  gameModes: ["tutorial"],
  teamFeatures: false,
  exportEnabled: false,
};

const PRO_FEATURES = {
  aiRecommendationsPerMonth: -1, // unlimited
  maxDecks: -1,
  maxComparisons: -1,
  gameModes: ["all"],
  teamFeatures: false,
  exportEnabled: true,
};
```

### 4.4 Webhook Handling

```typescript
// convex/stripeWebhook.ts
export const handleWebhook = httpAction(async (ctx, request) => {
  const signature = request.headers.get("stripe-signature");
  const body = await request.text();
  
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
    body,
    signature,
    process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  );
  
  switch (event.type) {
    case "checkout.session.completed":
      await handleCheckoutComplete(ctx, event.data.object);
      break;
    case "customer.subscription.updated":
      await handleSubscriptionUpdate(ctx, event.data.object);
      break;
    case "customer.subscription.deleted":
      await handleSubscriptionCanceled(ctx, event.data.object);
      break;
    case "invoice.payment_failed":
      await handlePaymentFailed(ctx, event.data.object);
      break;
  }
  
  return new Response("OK", { status: 200 });
});
```
