                   └─────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 High-Value Content Types

#### Comparison Pages (Highest Intent)
Create dedicated landing pages for every major comparison:

**Tier 1 (Highest Search Volume):**
- /compare/nextjs-vs-remix
- /compare/supabase-vs-firebase
- /compare/react-vs-vue
- /compare/prisma-vs-drizzle
- /compare/vercel-vs-netlify
- /compare/tailwind-vs-bootstrap

**Page Structure:**
```
1. Quick verdict (for skimmers)
2. Comparison table (features, pricing, pros/cons)
3. When to use each
4. AI recommendation CTA
5. FAQ section (featured snippets)
6. Related comparisons
```

#### "Best X for Y" Articles
- Best tech stack for SaaS in 2025
- Best database for startups
- Best React framework for beginners
- Best free hosting for side projects
- Best AI coding tools for developers

#### Tutorial + Tool Integration
- "How to build a SaaS with Next.js" → CTA: "Get your full stack recommendation"
- "Setting up authentication in 2025" → CTA: "Compare auth solutions"

### 2.3 Developer Community Engagement

#### Reddit Strategy (Organic)

**Subreddits to Engage:**
- r/webdev - Weekly "What are you working on?" threads
- r/reactjs - Answer technical questions
- r/SideProject - Share updates, get feedback
- r/startups - Tech stack advice threads

**Engagement Playbook:**
1. Create genuine value first (answer questions, share knowledge)
2. Build karma and reputation (2-4 weeks minimum)
3. Share tool naturally when relevant
4. Never spam or self-promote aggressively

**Example Natural Mention:**
```
Question: "What database should I use for my startup?"

Answer: "Depends on your needs:
- PostgreSQL: Best for complex queries, ACID compliance
- MongoDB: Better for flexible schemas, rapid iteration
- SQLite: Perfect for MVPs, zero config

For startups, I'd lean PostgreSQL via Supabase or Neon - you get 
managed hosting, auth, and real-time out of the box.

I actually built a tool (vibebuff.com) that helps with these decisions 
if you want personalized recommendations based on your specific project."
```

#### Hacker News Strategy

**Content Types That Work:**
- Show HN posts (launch announcements)
- Original research/data
- Controversial takes (with substance)
- Tool comparisons with real benchmarks

**Show HN Template:**
```
Title: Show HN: VIBEBUFF - AI-powered tech stack recommendations

Body: Hey HN,

I built VIBEBUFF because I was tired of spending days researching 
tools for every new project.

It asks about your project (budget, scale, team size, requirements) 
and recommends a complete stack with:
- Cost estimates at different scales
- Pros/cons for your specific use case
- Alternative options

Tech stack: Next.js, Convex, Clerk, Vercel

Free to use, no sign-up required for basic recommendations.

Would love feedback, especially on the recommendation accuracy.
