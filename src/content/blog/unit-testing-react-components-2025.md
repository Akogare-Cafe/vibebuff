## Testing React Components

Write tests that give you confidence without being brittle.

## Best Practices

1. Test behavior, not implementation
2. Use Testing Library queries (getByRole, getByText)
3. Avoid testing internal state
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Write integration tests for complex flows

## What to Test

- User interactions
- Conditional rendering
- Error states
- Accessibility
