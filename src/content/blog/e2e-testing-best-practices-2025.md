## E2E Testing Done Right

End-to-end tests verify your entire application works together.

## Playwright vs Cypress

Playwright: Multi-browser, multi-tab, faster, built-in parallel
Cypress: Great DX, time-travel debugging, component testing

## Best Practices

1. Use role-based locators, not CSS selectors
2. Wait for network, not arbitrary timeouts
3. Use Page Object Model
4. Run in CI with retries
