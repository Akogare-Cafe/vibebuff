## Level Up Your TypeScript

TypeScript's type system is incredibly powerful.

## Key Patterns

1. **Discriminated Unions**: Type-safe state machines
2. **Conditional Types**: Types that depend on other types
3. **Template Literal Types**: Type-safe string manipulation
4. **Mapped Types**: Transform existing types
5. **Branded Types**: Prevent mixing similar types
6. **Exhaustive Checks**: Ensure all cases handled
