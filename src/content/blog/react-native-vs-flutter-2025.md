## Cross-Platform Mobile Development

Building mobile apps for both iOS and Android? React Native and Flutter are the leading cross-platform frameworks.

## React Native Overview

React Native, created by Meta, uses JavaScript and React:

**Key Features:**
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Familiar web technologies
- **Native components**: Uses platform UI components
- **Hot reloading**: Fast development cycles
- **Large ecosystem**: npm packages available

## Flutter Overview

Flutter, created by Google, uses Dart:

**Key Features:**
- **Dart language**: Optimized for UI development
- **Custom rendering**: Skia graphics engine
- **Widget system**: Consistent across platforms
- **Material & Cupertino**: Platform-specific designs

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | React Native | Flutter |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Startup Time | Good | Excellent |
| Animation | Good | Excellent |
| App Size | Smaller | Larger |
| Memory Usage | Higher | Lower |

Flutter's custom rendering engine provides smoother animations, while React Native's bridge can introduce overhead.

## Developer Experience

### React Native
- Familiar for web developers
- Large npm ecosystem
- More debugging tools
- Expo for rapid development

### Flutter
- Hot reload is faster
- Better documentation
- Consistent UI across platforms
- DevTools are excellent

## When to Choose React Native

- Team knows JavaScript/React
- Need to share code with web
- Want native look and feel
- Using Expo for simplicity

## When to Choose Flutter

- Performance is critical
- Custom UI designs needed
- Starting fresh (no JS expertise)
- Need consistent cross-platform UI

## Job Market

| Framework | Job Postings | Salary Range |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| React Native | Higher | $100-150K |
| Flutter | Growing | $95-140K |

React Native has more job opportunities, but Flutter is growing rapidly.

## Our Recommendation

For **web developers** or teams with React experience, **React Native** offers a smoother transition. For **performance-critical apps** or teams starting fresh, **Flutter** provides excellent tooling and performance.
