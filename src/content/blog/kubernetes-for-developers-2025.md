## Kubernetes: Developer's Perspective

Focus on what developers actually need to know.

## Core Concepts

- **Pods**: Smallest deployable unit
- **Deployments**: Manage replicas and updates
- **Services**: Expose pods to network
- **ConfigMaps/Secrets**: Configuration management

## Essential Commands

kubectl get pods, kubectl logs, kubectl exec, kubectl port-forward, kubectl apply

## Tips

1. Start simple - one deployment, one service
2. Use namespaces for organization
3. Set resource limits
4. Add health checks
