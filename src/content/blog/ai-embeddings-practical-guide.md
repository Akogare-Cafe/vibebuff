## What Are Embeddings?

Embeddings convert text to numerical vectors that capture meaning.

## Use Cases

1. Semantic search
2. Recommendation systems
3. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
4. Clustering and classification

## Implementation

Use OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small or open-source alternatives like sentence-transformers.
